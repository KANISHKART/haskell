Paloma's drawing
Paloma is a six-year-old girl. She is in the first year of school and loves to draw. Her main activity in class is to draw objects so that she can learn to read.

One of Paloma's teachers is called Beatriz. She asked the pupils to draw something they really liked. Some children drew toys.

Paloma decided to draw a picture of her parents. She drew her mother in a red dress and her father in a yellow shirt.

She also drew her dog, called Bombom. When she gets home, her dog starts running around and she always gives him cookies.

Paloma's drawing was highly praised during the lesson. She got full marks for having done her best to draw and paint the pictures.
